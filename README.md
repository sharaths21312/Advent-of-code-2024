# Advent of Code 2024
These are my solutions for the 2024 Advent of code (mostly in C#, although I did try a few others)

## Running solutions:
Make a inputs folder, and place the input in the form of "dayx.txt" (eg day1.txt), then run `dotnet script ./csharp/[scriptfile].csx` from the repository root
